# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose is to analyse data of ride sharing information throughout several city types. Comparison of fares, drivers, and location will be used to create a visualization that will help make future decisions for PyBer.

## Results
* Rural city types had the highest average fare per ride but also the highest average fare per driver with the lowest amount of rides.
* Suburban city types had higher amount of total rides and better ratio of average fare per ride / average fare per driver than rural cities. 
* Urban city types are the most profitable with the most total rides and better average fare per ride / average fare per driver ratio than all city types.
